    <h4 style="color:var(--secondary);">Competitor Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      The competitor analysis focused on three types of museum websites: virtual-only museums, physical museums with virtual components, and Hispanic/Latin cultural museums. The analysis involved a detailed review of how these museums structured their websites and facilitated user access to their virtual experiences. I examined layout patterns, content strategies, user flow, and audience targeting, paying particular attention to the effectiveness of navigation, calls to action (CTAs), and the overall user experience.

      Key insights were derived from evaluating how these organizations engage visitors with their digital offerings. The analysis considered multiple access points on the websites, common design elements, and the specific target audience of school students and educational institutions.
