    <h5>My Design Process</h5>
    <div class="process-grid">
      <div class="process-step">
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <h3>UX & Market Research</h3>
        <p>I begin with the goals, audience, and context. Through user interviews, competitive analysis, and assessing business needs, I gather insights that influence my direction.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <h3>UI: Ideate & Brainstorm</h3>
        <p>I brainstorm a variety of solutions, sketching ideas, and creating wireframes on Figma. I also quickly whip up prototypes and concepts, if need be.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <h3>UI: Wireframes & Prototype</h3>
        <p>Once I have a clear direction and I receive my go-ahead, I develop high-fidelity mockups. At this stage, I focus on working with both aesthetics and usability.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <h3>Test, Iterate, Present</h3>
        <p>I conduct testing, gather feedback by presenting it to peers and stakeholders, and then fine-tune the final design. I am very flexible with stakeholder feedback, making designs that satisfy business goals as well as consumer/user needs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="process-step">
        <h4>Additional Step</h4>
        <h3>Post-Design</h3>
        <p>If required, I am able to create content using Adobe Suite, Canva and AI, as well as use front end web development and software such as Wix, WordPress, HTML and CSS; as well as maintain and update the digital products.</p>
