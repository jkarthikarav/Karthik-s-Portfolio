      <p class="p1">Did the pitch deck website help secure the movie producer’s (who was also approached to be the lead actor) involvement?</p>
      <p class="p2">While I wasn’t directly involved in contract negotiations, the meetings did go forward as planned and the website was presented to positive effect.</p>

      <p class="p1">Was the solution properly implemented?</p>
      <p class="p2">Yes, the solution was implemented as it was economically and technologically feasible as well as impactful. The director was pleased with how I had used modern tools to elevate the pitch beyond a PowerPoint presentation. This project led to a successful 3-year collaboration with the director and their writing team on various movie projects and pitch decks.</p>

      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: Thoughts and Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="p2">The goal of this project was to make a digital pitch deck that while solving for the limitations of a traditional pitch deck, was also innovative and technically sound.<br><br>
​
A pitch deck website was a unique solution but with innovation comes new problems - here, it was the autoplay limitation on browsers. However, this problem was solved by incorporating a button to provoke a user interaction, while also maintaining the spy/espionage theme of the pitch deck.
</p>
      <p><strong>Key takeaway: UX for Creative Industries</strong></p>
      <p class="p2">A Pitch deck is primarily a business presentation document, and incorporating a non-traditional format allows for UX to be used in Creative industries such as Film and Advertising.</p>
    	<p><strong>Key takeaway: Understanding real-world technical limitations</strong></p>
      	<p class="p2">Product solutions always seem feasible when doing research, but an understanding of the existing software/hardware limitations might help design a Product that works in the real world.</p>
