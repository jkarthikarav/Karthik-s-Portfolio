      <p class="p1">Was the solution properly implemented?</p>
      <p class="p2">Yes, the solution was implemented as it was economically and technologically feasible as well as impactful. The director was pleased with how I had used modern tools to elevate the pitch beyond a PowerPoint presentation.

      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: Thoughts and Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="p2">The goal of this project was to make a digital pitch deck that while solving for the limitations of a traditional pitch deck, was also innovative and technically sound.<br><br>
​
A pitch deck website was a unique solution but with innovation comes new problems - here, it was the autoplay limitation on browsers. However, this problem was creatively bypassed using interactive elements that fit thematically.
</p>
	<p class="section-title" style="font-size:16px;text-align:left; margin-bottom: 0;">Key Takeaway: UX for Creative Industries</p>
        <div style="height: 1px; background-color: var(--grey2); width: 100%; margin-top: 0;"></div>
      		<p class="p2">A Pitch deck is primarily a business presentation document, and incorporating a non-traditional format allows for UX to be used in Creative industries such as Film and Advertising.</p>
    	<p class="section-title" style="font-size:16px;text-align:left; margin-bottom: 0;">Key Takeaway: Understanding real-world technical limitations</p>
        <div style="height: 1px; background-color: var(--grey2); width: 100%; margin-top: 0;"></div>
      		<p class="p2">Product solutions always seem feasible when doing research, but an understanding of the existing software/hardware limitations might help design a Product that works in the real world.</p>
