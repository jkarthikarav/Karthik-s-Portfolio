      <h3 class="content-heading">Summary</h3>
      <p>I collaborated with an Indian ethnic wear fashion boutique on a short-term campaign. The primary goal was to help the boutique establish its presence in the digital space and stay relevant in the competitive fashion market.
The project involved both digital strategy and physical graphic design to provide a cohesive brand identity across both digital and in-store experiences.

    <p class="p2">
      As part of my role, I created and managed a social media content calendar, strategically designing 1x3 post grids to establish a visually cohesive and aesthetic Instagram feed. I produced 30-second Instagram reels using catalog photos provided by the boutique, highlighting key products in a format tailored to boost engagement. With the website still under construction during the campaign, I handled direct communication through Instagram DMs, responding to potential buyers and reaching out to influencers to explore partnership opportunities and build early brand visibility.
