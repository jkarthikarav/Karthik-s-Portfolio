    <p class="p2">
      We conducted discovery research to understand our target audience, to evaluate the current state of museums and analyze purchasing behaviors: 
<br><br>1. How can we make museum admission information more apparent to people?¬†
<br>2. How do people feel about ticket prices in museums?¬†
<br><br>Through our secondary research, we found that numerous articles and websites (including the Museums themselves) provide discounted and/or free museum admission in Toronto. However, discussions on social media reveal that many people perceive museum tickets as expensive, and awareness of discounts is very low. Despite free admission options at some of Toronto‚Äôs most well-known museums, these opportunities are often not used due to a lack of information. We then conducted interviews through Zoom using a questionnaire.‚Äã
<br><br><em><strong>Toronto offers many museum experiences, but ticket booking is fragmented. Each institution handles admissions differently, making it difficult for users to compare prices, find deals, or plan visits. Users need a single, visually clear, and reliable source for museum tickets, especially for discovering free and discounted options.

      Mary is a fictitious human birthed by the group's research data. A hard-working and busy student, when time allows, opts to visit museums with her friends or even Solo!
<br><br>Mary's attempt to visit a museum in the modern day and age mirrors the challenges faced by many Torontonians. Despite prolonged efforts to find discounted tickets, the benefits are overshadowed by the time spent searching.
<br><br>The delay results in exceeding her budget, highlighting the difficulties in navigating the process of obtaining affordable tickets for museum visits.‚Äã

      <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion: Thoughts and Takeaways</h2>
      <p class="p2">The goal of this project was to create a clean, functional UI that simplifies how Torontonians discover and access museum ticket deals.
<br><br>Designing around real-world fragmentation (many museums, different systems) required a UI that could bring coherence without overwhelming the user. Through visual hierarchy, smart filtering, and minimal navigation, we created a prototype that felt both local and user-friendly.
<br><br>Also, I envisioned it as an AI-powered interface: its recommendations and event highlights would adapt based on user preferences and behaviour data, improving relevance over time.
</p>
<p class="section-title" style="font-size:16px;text-align:left; margin-bottom: 0;">Key Takeaway: Design clarity</p>
        <div style="height: 1px; background-color: var(--grey2); width: 100%; margin-top: 0;"></div>
      <p class="p2">When systems behind the scenes are messy, UI must work harder to maintain simplicity. The interface must earn the user‚Äôs trust by making complexity invisible.
